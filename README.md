# Teaching tools
A collection of light weight tools that I developed to facilitate my teaching.

# autograder
An autograder I made for accepting code submissions.
(Written in Python.)

# calendar_generator
Generates some HTML calendars for use in making a class schedule.
(Written in C++.)

# cheat_finder
Compares code (ignoring whitespace, variable names, etc.) and identifies the most similar submissions.
(Written in C++.)

# grade_tracking
A PHP page that provides students with the ability to view their scores.

# record_lecture_scripts
Some scripts I wrote for recording lectures and processing and distributing the videos.

# group_site
An extremely light weight wiki-like web site implemented with just a few simple PHP pages.
