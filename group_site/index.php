<h3>Group site</h3>
This is an extremely light weight web site that works like a wiki (meaning anyone with the password can edit it).
It is implemented with just a few PHP pages.
It uses straight HTML, not wiki syntax.
It requires no database, and is easy to customize because it is so light weight.
Here are instructions for setting it up:
<ol>
	<li>Edit the file "edit.php". Change the password (on line 2).</li>
	<li>Customize header.php and footer.php to your liking.</li>
	<li>Click the "Edit page" link to start adding content.</li>
</ol>
That's it!
