<h1>Autograder documentation</h1>

<br>
<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>
	So I wrote an autograder in Python.
	I used it in Spring 2024 to teach EECS Programming Foundations 2,
	and DASC Data Structures and Algorithms.
	I think it carries more than its own weight.
	However, there are both pros and cons to using an autograder:
</p>

<h3>Some pros:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students get instant feedback.</li>
	<li>It reduces work for the TAs,
		freeing them up to help students more.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some cons:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Implementing meaningful evaluations can be a challenge.</li>
	<li>Students feel less watched.
		This may make them feel more comfortable cheating.</li>
	<li>Any bugs will affect the whole class all at once,
		leading to potential mass emergencies.</li>
	<li>The VPN is cumbersome to work with.</li>
	<li>Needy students will blame their lateness on a surprise
		inability to work with the VPN at critical moments.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Getting started</h2>

<br>
<b>Step 1: Get a VM</b>

<p>
	Jason Crawley set up a VM for me at jacquard.ddns.uark.edu at U of A.
	My only complaint is that I have to be connected to the VPN to connect to it.
	But apparently, there's nothing they can do about that.
	So maybe ask him to set up a VM for you.
</p>

<br>
<b>Step 2: Make a place on the VM for the autograder</b>

like this:

<pre class="code">
globalprotect launch-ui       # connect to the VM
ssh [username]@[hostname]     # ssh into the VM
cd /var/www                   # go to where you want it
sudo mkdir autograder         # make a folder for it
cd                            # return to your home folder
ln -s /var/www/autograder     # make a symlink (for convenience)
sudo adduser sandbox          # make an account for running jobs
exit                          # return to your computer
</pre>

<br>
<b>Step 3: Copy the autograder to the VPN</b>

<pre class="code">
cd teaching_tools/autograder
scp -r * [username]@[hostname]:/var/www/autograder/
</pre>

Also, make a file named config.json with the following contents,

<pre class="code">
{
    "port": 80,
    "monitor": 30
}
</pre>

<p>and put it in the autograder folder.
(On my laptop, I run it on a different port and don't include the "monitor" field.
That way, I can see it working on my machine before I push my changes to the VM.)</p>

<p>You will also need to install a few packages, like mypy, requests, sd-notify, and whatever else it complains about when you first try to run it:<br>
<pre class="code">
python3 -m pip install mypy==1.8.0
python3 -m pip install requests
python3 -m pip install sd-notify
</pre>
</p>

<p>Now, try running it:<br>
<pre class="code">
sudo ./run.bash
</pre></p>

<p>Press Ctrl-C to stop. (We'll start customizing it later.)</p>


<br>
<b>Step 4: Run it as a systemd service</b>

<p>A systemd service will continue running after you log out.
It will restart your server one each day.
It will also check that the server is healthy at regular intervals,
and automatically restart it if it does not respond in a timely manner.
This ensures the system will remain accessible even when naive students
submit surprisingly stupid things (like endless loops that leak memory
and spew huge volumes of data to a file, etc.)</p>

<p>So make a textfile named autograder.service with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="code">
[Unit]
Description=A daemon for receiving and partly checking homework submissions
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=notify
WatchdogSec=600
Restart=always
RuntimeMaxSec=86400
RestartSec=1
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /var/www/autograder/back_end/main.py
StandardOutput=append:/var/www/autograder/stdout.txt
StandardError=append:/var/www/autograder/stderr.txt

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</pre>

<p>Copy this file to /etc/systemd/system on your VM.
Then activate it with the following commands:</p>

<pre class="code">
sudo systemctl enable autograder.service
sudo systemctl start autograder.service
</pre>

<p>Now the server is running as a service.
To test it, visit http://[hostname]/pf2_admin.html.
The default password for all new accounts is "change_me".
As soon as you enter that, it will force you to change it to something else.
</p>

<p>If you want to stop the server,
for example if you want to manually hack the scores or prevent submissions after dead day,
use the following command:<br>
<pre class="code">
sudo systemctl stop autograder.service
</pre>

<p>I frequently make changes in the back_end folder
(because that's where the code that evaluates submissions is located),
so for convenience I made this script to copy back_end changes from my laptop over to the VM:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
set -e
scp back_end/*.py [username]@[hostname]:/var/www/autograder/back_end/
</pre>

<p>After you update the code, you still need to ssh into the VM and restart the server:
<pre class="code">
sudo systemctl restart autograder.service
</pre>


<br>
<h2>Tour of the code</h2>

<p>In order to use the autograder effectively,
you will need to be at least somewhat familiar with the code.
So let's take a quick little tour:</p>

<p>Here's what you will find in the autograder folder:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>run.bash</b>: A script that type-checks the back_end Python code, then launches the server.</li>
		<li><b>config.json</b>: Specifies which port to run the server on, and how frequently to perform health checks.</li>
		<li><b>state.json</b>: Stores session info (so you don't have to log in every time you visit).</li>
		<li><b>stdout.txt</b>: Whatever you "print" will go to this file.</li>
		<li><b>stderr.txt</b>: Whatever you "log" will go tho this file. This is the main server log. If something isn't working right, I open this file in vim and go to line 0 (the end) to see if any exceptions were logged.</li>
		<li><b>pf2</b>: The folder where all PF2 submissions will go.</li>
		<li><b>pf2/scores.json</b>: The master record of all PF2 password hashes and project scores.
			If you fear data loss, this is the file you want to back up.
			It contains everything you would need to restore your class and get it going again.
		</li>
		<li><b>dsa</b>: The folder where all Data Structures and Algorithms submissions will go.</li>
		<li><b>dsa/scores.json</b>: The master record of all DSA password hashes and project scores.</li>
		<li><b>front_end</b>: The folder where web content goes.</li>
		<li><b>front_end/banner.png</b>: The university logo that appears at the top of all pages.</li>
		<li><b>front_end/sha512.js</b>: Script for hasing passwords (so passwords are never transmitted in plain text).</li>
		<li><b>back_end</b>: The folder where server code goes.</li>
		<li><b>back_end/http_daemon.py</b>: This file contains the engine for the web server. It implements the HTTP protocol to communicate with web browsers.</li>
		<li><b>back_end/autograder.py</b>: This file contains the main engine for the autograder. If you want to improve any general autograder features, you will do it in this file.</li>
		<li><b>back_end/autograder.py</b>: This file contains the main engine for the autograder. If you want to improve any general autograder features, they probably belong in this file.</li>
		<li><b>back_end/pf2.py</b>: This file contains the code for checking PF2 submissions. (If you update a project, you will need to update this file to check it properly.)</li>
		<li><b>back_end/dsa.py</b>: This file contains the code for checking DSA submissions. (If you update a project, you will need to update this file to check it properly.)</li>
		<li><b>back_end/main.py</b>: This is where the server begins. You will find a list of URL entrypoints in this file.</li>
		<li><b>back_end/sus.py</b>: A plagiarism detection script. (It is not-yet integrated with the autograder, but I have big plans.)
		<li><b>back_end/banana_quest.py</b>: This is left over from a game I made for Paradigms. It is what eventually evolved into this submission server. Basically, it is now outdated garbage, but I'm keeping it around in case I decide to do another MMO game in a future Paradigms class.
	</ul>



<br>
<h2>Setting up your class</h2>

<p>In pf2.py (or dsa.py) you will see a data structure named "course_desc".
This data structure specifies the due dates, titles, and weights for all of your class projects.
And most significantly, you also provide an "evaluator" for each project.
The "evaluator" is a function that checks a project submission.
If any problem is found, this function should raise an autograder.RejectSubmission error.
If no problems are found, it should update the student's scores and call autograder.accept_submission.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Submission requirements</h2>

<p>Each submission is required to contain a file named "run.bash".
This is expected to be a script that will build and execute the student's code.
(I think this helps students get used to scripting their build processes.)
It must also pass any arguments forward to the student's app
(so it should be executed with $* as the argument.)
The autograder will pass arguments to this script and pipe the output to a file,
which it will then search for expected output values.
</p>

<p>The amount of drive space I was given was pretty small.
Consequently, I imposed a lot of rules about which types of files are allowed to occur in submissions.
To my surprise, students seemed to have great difficulty controlling what ended up in their zip files.
So be prepared to explain:
<ul>
	<li>Neither Windows Explorer nor Mac Finder shows hidden files by default.</li>
	<li>The BASH command "ls -al" will show hidden files and folders.</li>
	<li>The "." and ".." folders are not a problem, and do not need to be deleted.</li>
	<li>The .DS_Store folder is created by Finder. You cannot delete it while a Finder
		window is showing your project folder.</li>
	<li>The .settings folder is created by VS Code (when it is installed in some particular way).
		VS Code will keep recreating it if you keep it open.</li>
	<li>The zip command does not replace an existing zip file. It adds to it.
		So if you want to delete a file, you must delete the zip file and recreated it.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>My grading style is kind of unusual, so you may want to tweak that.
I grant all the students 7 free "late tokens" when I create their accounts.
(You can change this in the add_students function in autograder.py.)
I automatically give submissions that pass my checks full credit minus
3 points per day late, for a minimum score of 30.
(You can change this as you desire in the accept_submission function in pf2.py or dsa.py.)
